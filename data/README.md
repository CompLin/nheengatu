The glossary in the `glossary.txt` file of this folder was first copied and pasted as raw text from pages 103--111 of the following book:

NAVARRO, Eduardo de Almeida. **Curso de Língua Geral (nheengatu ou tupi moderno)**: a língua das origens da civilização amazônica. 2. ed. São Paulo: Centro Angel Rama da Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas da Universidade de São Paulo, 2016.

Copyright of this book belongs to its author, Professor Eduardo de Almeida Navarro of the University of São Paulo. The glossary is made available here solely to promote research, teaching and learning of the Nheengatú language. Therefore, this material and all derived  data shouldn't be used for any commercial purposes.

Formating inconsistencies and minor errors in some glossary entries were detected and corrected. The glossary was processed by bash and Python scripts to extract the relevant information for the computational processing of Nheengatú, mostly for tagging and lemmatization. The extracted lexical information is encoded in different data structures stored in the other files of this folder.
