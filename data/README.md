The contents of the `glossary.txt` file of this folder was first copied and pasted as raw text from the glossary in the pages 103--111 of the following book:

NAVARRO, Eduardo de Almeida. **Curso de Língua Geral (nheengatu ou tupi moderno)**: a língua das origens da civilização amazônica. 2. ed. São Paulo: Centro Angel Rama da Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas da Universidade de São Paulo, 2016.

Copyright of this book belongs to its author, Professor Eduardo de Almeida Navarro of the University of São Paulo. The version of the glossary in this repository is made available here solely to promote research, teaching and learning of the Nheengatú language. Therefore, this material and all derived  data shouldn't be used for any commercial purposes.

Minor formating inconsistencies in the glossary were corrected. Besides, some entries were changed to make the lexical information more explicit for computational processing. All changes can be tracked with the help of the commit history. Most of the changes, if not all, have been documented in the issues.     

The glossary was processed by bash and Python scripts to extract the relevant information for the computational processing of Nheengatú, mostly for tagging and lemmatization. The extracted lexical information is encoded in different data structures stored in the other files of this folder.

If you detect any errors in the data, please submit an issue.
